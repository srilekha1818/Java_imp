Data types
==========
In real world how many types of data we actually come cross?
1. Number
a. Integral type
byte,short,int,long
b. Floating type
float,double

2. Character
a. char
3. Boolean type
a. boolean
4. Images,audio,video
a. LOB's(Large Object)
What is the need of dataype is java langauge?
=> Every variable has a type,every expression has a type and all types are
strictly defined,moreover every assignement
should be checked by the compiler for type compatiblity, hence java langauge is
strictly typed programming language.
=> Since the language is strictly typed, we expect the programmer to specify the
type of data we are keeping inside the
variable.
=> To tell what type of data is kept inside the variable to the langauge, we need
to tell through "DataType".
eg::
int a;
int b = a+10;
Is java a dynamic programming language?
=> Java is dynamic programming language,because memory for the datatype is
allocated by the JVM at the runtime.
int a = 10;
|=> datatype(used by compiler to check for compatability)
|=> During the execution of the program,jvm sees int, allocates 4 bytes of
memory as per datatype specification
and the value 10 will be stored inside 4bytes memory and for that
4bytes memory name is assigned as "a".
Dynamically typed language
==========================
a = 10;
a ="sachin";
a = 54.5;
a = true;
eg:: python,javascript,php,......
